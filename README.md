# Car Model Classification using Keras
## About
This repository was created for a deep learning course which took place at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) and was lectured by Prof. Luciano Rebou√ßas. 
For it's final project we were asked to create and train two different models of our choosing over the [Stanford Cars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset).

These are the models I chose:
 - VGG19
 - ResNet50V2

We were instructed to train these models and evaluate their performance through the construction of graphs and using the k-fold cross-validation method.

## My Results
Although the results weren't the greatest, considering the limited time alocated for this project, I see it as a good result. All models were trained on 50 epochs and using 3-fold cross-validation, more information can be found in the [main notebook](https://github.com/davidolima/car-model-classification/blob/main/main.ipynb).

| Model | Loss | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | F1-Score | mAP |
|  ---  |  --- |    ---   |   ---  |    ---    |    ---   | --- |
| VGG-19 | 3.970 |  0.292   | 0.206  |   0.494   |  0.289   | 0.405 |
| ResNet50V2 | 62.588 |  0.386   | 0.386  |   0.387   |  0.386   | 0.495 |
