This repository was created for a deep learning course at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) which was lectured by Prof. Luciano Rebou√ßas. 
For it's final project we needed to create and train four different models of our choosing on the [Stanford Cars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset).

These are the models I chose:
 - VGG19
 - ResNet50V2
 - EfficientNetB0
 - InceptionV3

We were instructed to train these models and evaluate their performance through the construction of graphs and using the k-fold cross-validation method.
