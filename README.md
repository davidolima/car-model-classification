# Car Model Classification using Keras
## About
This repository was created for a deep learning course which took place at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA) and was lectured by Prof. Luciano Rebou√ßas. 
For it's final project we were asked to create and train two different models of our choosing over the [Stanford Cars Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset).

These are the models I chose:
 - VGG19
 - ResNet50V2

We were instructed to train these models and evaluate their performance through the construction of graphs and using the k-fold cross-validation method.

## My Results
### Trained on 50 epochs and using 3-fold cross-validation

| Model | Loss | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | F1-Score | mAP |
|  ---  |  --- |    ---   |   ---  |    ---    |    ---   | --- |
| VGG-19 | 3.778 | 0.284 | 0.177 | 0.495 | 0.259 | 0.402 |
| ResNet50V2 | 62.971 |  0.397   | 0.397  |   0.397   |  0.397   | 0.505 |
